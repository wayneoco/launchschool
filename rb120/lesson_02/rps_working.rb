Notes on RPS bonus features:

# Keeping Score

- added setter and getter methods for :score to the Player class
- then added the following methods to the RPSGame class:
  - calculate_score
  - display_score
  - calculate_grand_winner
  - display_grand_winner

# Adding Lizard and Spock

- added the relevant additions to the move choices, in addition to updating the rules

# Add a class for each move

- I don't think it would make sense to add each move as its own class.
- Each move would be a subclass of the Move class.
- However, the move class only has one stateâ€” the move name.
